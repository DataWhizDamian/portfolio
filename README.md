# 🎓 Portfolio [Archive 2025]

Welcome to my portfolio!  
This repository contains a little selection of projects completed during my **Engineering degree in Business Engineering – Application of IT in Business** (graduated in **January 2025**).

These projects reflect my academic journey and practical applications of **data science**, **analytics**, and **business intelligence** concepts.  
During my studies, I worked with tools and technologies such as:

- **Python**
- **R**
- **SQL**
- **Java**
- **Tableau**
- **Power BI**
- **RapidMiner**
- **Excel**

Although these projects were created for academic purposes, they showcase my ability to **analyze data**, **design solutions**, and **deliver results** that connect both technical and business perspectives.

> 📌 Note: This repository serves as an **archive** of my engineering studies work. My current and future projects will be published in a separate repository.
